  how to implement dev-sec-ops practices?
  ------------------------------------------

  -> by using tools
    how to choose tools?
     -> by costing
     -> by features
     -> by community support
     -> by integration with other tools
     -> by ease of use
     -> by scalability
     -> by security features
     -> by performance

  -> by using scripts
     -> dynamic language scripts
        -> python
        -> groovy
        -> shell scripts..
